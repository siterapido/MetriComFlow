## üîß Configuration Required

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Configure Webhook in Asaas Dashboard

The webhook endpoint is ready, but you need to manually configure it in Asaas:

1. **Go to:** https://app.asaas.com/webhooks
2. **Click:** "Novo Webhook"
3. **URL:** `https://fjoaliipjfcnokermkhy.supabase.co/functions/v1/asaas-webhook`
4. **Status:** Ativo
5. **Select 17 events:**
   - PAYMENT_CREATED
   - PAYMENT_UPDATED
   - PAYMENT_CONFIRMED
   - PAYMENT_RECEIVED
   - PAYMENT_OVERDUE
   - PAYMENT_DELETED
   - PAYMENT_RESTORED
   - PAYMENT_REFUNDED
   - PAYMENT_RECEIVED_IN_CASH
   - PAYMENT_CHARGEBACK_REQUESTED
   - PAYMENT_CHARGEBACK_DISPUTE
   - PAYMENT_AWAITING_CHARGEBACK_REVERSAL
   - SUBSCRIPTION_CREATED
   - SUBSCRIPTION_UPDATED
   - SUBSCRIPTION_DELETED
   - TRANSFER_CREATED
   - TRANSFER_UPDATED

**Authorization:** The webhook requires the Supabase anon key in the `Authorization: Bearer` header. Asaas will automatically include this if you configure it in the webhook settings.

## üß™ Testing Scripts

### Test Subscription Creation:
```bash
npx tsx scripts/test-asaas-subscription.ts
```

### Test Webhook Events:
```bash
./scripts/test-webhook-locally.sh
```

### View Webhook Logs:
```bash
npx supabase functions logs asaas-webhook --tail
```

### Check Database:
```bash
# Check payments
npx supabase db execute --query "
  SELECT * FROM subscription_payments
  ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5;
"

# Check subscription status
npx supabase db execute --query "
  SELECT status, last_payment_date, next_billing_date
  FROM organization_subscriptions
  WHERE asaas_subscription_id = 'sub_fr09q374mxgxulz6';
"
```

## üìö Documentation Created

1. [ASAAS_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md](./ASAAS_WEBHOOK_SETUP.md) - Complete webhook configuration guide
2. [test-webhook-locally.sh](../scripts/test-webhook-locally.sh) - Webhook testing script
3. [test-asaas-subscription.ts](../scripts/test-asaas-subscription.ts) - End-to-end subscription test

## üé® Frontend Pages

### Current Status:
- ‚úÖ Subscription plans page (`/planos`)
- ‚úÖ Plan cards with features and pricing
- ‚úÖ Usage meters (ad accounts, users)
- ‚úÖ Upgrade/downgrade flow with validation
- ‚úÖ Trial status display
- ‚úÖ Sidebar menu item (owner-only)

### Next Steps - Checkout Flow:
- ‚è≥ Checkout form component
- ‚è≥ Payment method selector (Card/PIX/Boleto)
- ‚è≥ Billing information collection
- ‚è≥ Payment confirmation page
- ‚è≥ Invoice history display

## üîí Security Notes

### Current Implementation:
- ‚úÖ Service role key stored as Supabase secret (not exposed to client)
- ‚úÖ RLS policies on all subscription tables
- ‚úÖ Organization-scoped data access
- ‚úÖ Webhook validates POST requests only
- ‚úÖ CORS enabled for Asaas callbacks

### Production Recommendations:
1. Add webhook signature validation (Asaas provides signed requests)
2. Implement rate limiting on webhook endpoint
3. Add idempotency keys for payment processing
4. Enable webhook retry logic (Asaas retries 3x automatically)
5. Set up monitoring and alerts for failed webhooks
